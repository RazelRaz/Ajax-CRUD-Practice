# Ajax CRUD Practice

Ajax CRUD Practice
This repository contains a practice project for implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Ajax, Axios, and the Milligram CSS framework. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on experience with Ajax and showcase how to perform asynchronous operations on a web page without the need for page reloads.
